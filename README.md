This repository is a place where I can log my current reasoning and skillset in Javascript.
The idea is to create some solutions to common problems using JS.

It will also keep me honest with some weekly training to 'sharpen the sword'


# 2020 Advent of code

I am taking part in the https://adventofcode.com/ this year. Lets see what Chrsitmas will bring (probably just 25 days of coding puzzle).

### Day 1 
TwoSum challenge with a slight twist. Finding instaces of the sum of two integers that add up to 2020.
Then a ThreeSum problem on the same dataset. (This one I will need to redo as I bruteforced it before my ears bled.)

### Day 2 
Password checking. Today took me 30 mins just to format the data into JSON. There is a gaping hole in my regex game.
I added some Regex study time to my list.

### Day 3
Living in the French Alps must have helped me today. Challenge of toboganning down a mountain trying to avoid trees.
Today is the first day in a few years that I have written an algo that works, with no debugging and is relativley elegant.
