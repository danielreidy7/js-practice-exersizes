This repository is a place where I can log my current reasoning and skill-set in Javascript.
The idea is to create some solutions to common problems using JS.

It will also keep me honest with some weekly training to 'sharpen the sword'


# 2020 Advent of code

I am taking part in the https://adventofcode.com/ this year. Lets see what Christmas will bring.

### Day 1 
TwoSum challenge with a slight twist. Finding instances of the sum of two integers that add up to 2020.
Then a ThreeSum problem on the same dataset. (This one I will need to redo as I brute-forced it before my ears bled.)

### Day 2 
Password checking. Today took me 30 mins just to format the data into JSON. There is a gaping hole in my regex game.
I added some Regex study time to my list.

### Day 3
Living in the French Alps must have helped me today. Challenge of tobogganing down a mountain trying to avoid trees.
Today is the first day in a few years that I have written a solution that works, with no debugging and is relatively elegant.

### Day 4
Passport Data processing at the Elf Airport. 
REGEX some more REGEX and then some hidden traps to fool your regex. 
‚òòÔ∏è‚òòÔ∏è‚òòÔ∏è The luck of the üáÆüá™ I did a refresher course on regex LAST NIGHT! ‚òòÔ∏è‚òòÔ∏è‚òòÔ∏è.
Need to work on my conditional reasoning. Part 2 took far longer than it should have.

### Day 5
Today was the first day of snow here in France. Flight boarding problem: solution for seat allocation.

### Day 6
Customs form data puzzle involving finding common answers. My regex skills are improving.
This puzzle showed up my weakness dealing with objects in JS.

### Day 7
Handy Haversacks. Simple algorithm to find all the types of bags that can contain my bad-ass gold sack!.
Used some simple regex and build a JSON object. The rest was a simple loop.
